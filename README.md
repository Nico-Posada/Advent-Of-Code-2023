# Advent-Of-Code-2023
Archive of my solutions. I will be doing my best to golf all of them for fun (:

I am not counting the shebang line as part of the length of the solution, and I won't hard code any of the solutions

You can run each solution by running `./part(1|2).(ext) < input.txt` in your terminal (you may have to change the shebang line depending on your environment)
